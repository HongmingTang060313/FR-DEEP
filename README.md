# FR DEEP

** this is still under construction, please be aware of this **

FR DEEP is a dataset of labeled radio galaxies used for deep learning training. It's a subset of the training data of 'Transfer Learning for Radio Galaxy Classification', where data in the work experienced data augmentation based on FR DEEP. These labeled samples came from FRICAT and CoNFIG catalogs. Each considered sample has been classified as either FR I or FR II radio source with certainty. If you use the dataset please cite arXiv:1903.11921 [astro-ph.IM].

# The FR DEEP Batched Dataset
The FR DEEP batched dataset comprises two separate sub-datasets: NVSS set and FIRST set. The two sub sets adopted same objects from the two aforementioned catalogs. Sample images are downloaded via Skyview Virtual Observatory, and experienced:
(1) sigma-clipping
